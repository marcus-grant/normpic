# NormPic - Photo Organization & Manifest Generator TODO

## Project Overview

NormPic is a photo organization tool that normalizes photo collections by
renaming files based on temporal and camera metadata,
creating symlinks with standardized names,
and generating JSON manifests for interoperability with
other tools like Galleria (gallery builder).

## Architecture Overview

- **Manifest-Centric Design**: All decisions flow through JSON Schema-validated manifests
- **Protocol-Based Integration**:
  - Parent projects provide implementations for external concerns
- **TDD Approach**: Integration tests first, then unit tests following RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
- **Lazy Processing**: Skip unchanged photos based on timestamps and hashes

  |-- doc/
  |-- pyproject.toml
  ```

- [x] Add pre-commit hook with commit message validation
- [ ] Create checkpoint branch for incomplete daily work
- [ ] Initialize documentation structure

### 2. Schema & Models Architecture

**Versioned Schema Approach:**
- `lib/model/schema_v1.py` - JSON Schema definitions as Python constants
- `lib/model/schema_v0.py` - Future: legacy compatibility schemas
- Schema version evolution through code, not files

**Serializer Pattern:**
- `lib/serializer/` - Peer directory to `lib/model/`
- Handles JSON serialization/deserialization separate from data models
- Schema validation logic centralized in serializer layer

### 3. Data Models (`lib/model/`)

- [ ] Create `Pic` dataclass with all metadata fields
- [ ] Create `Manifest` class with:
  - JSON serialization/deserialization
  - Schema validation
  - Version tracking
- [ ] Create `Config` class for collection configuration
- [ ] Add validation methods for all models
- [ ] Document models in `doc/modules/models.md`

### 4. Core Processing (`lib/core/`)

#### 4.1 EXIF Extraction (`exif_extractor.py`)

- [ ] Review `deleteme-normpic-modules/test/` for EXIF test cases
- [ ] Extract timestamp with subsecond precision
- [ ] Extract camera make/model
- [ ] Extract GPS coordinates
- [ ] Handle missing EXIF gracefully
- [ ] Return structured metadata dict
- [ ] Document EXIF handling in `doc/modules/exif.md`

#### 4.2 Filename Generation (`filename_generator.py`)

- [ ] Implement naming format: `{collection-?}{YY-MM-DDTHHMMSS}{-camera?}{-counter?}.ext`
- [ ] Use Base32 hex (0-9, a-v) for burst counter
- [ ] Handle timestamp conflicts with burst detection
- [ ] Normalize extensions (.jpeg \u2192 .jpg)
- [ ] Document naming conventions in `doc/guides/naming.md`

#### 4.3 Pic Organization (`pic_organizer.py`)

- [ ] Review `deleteme-normpic-modules/test/` for ordering test specs
- [ ] Implement ordering algorithm:
  1. EXIF timestamp (with subsec)
  2. Filename sequence
  3. Filesystem mtime
- [ ] Handle burst sequences (don't interrupt by other cameras)
- [ ] Detect when processing needed (hash/timestamp changes)
- [ ] Document ordering logic in `doc/modules/organization.md`

### 5. Managers (`lib/manager/`)

#### 5.1 Manifest Manager

- [ ] Load existing manifest with validation
- [ ] Detect changes requiring reprocessing:
  - File hash changes
  - Timestamp changes
  - Config changes (collection name, etc.)
  - Missing destination files
- [ ] Update manifest with processing results
- [ ] Write manifest atomically
- [ ] Create dry-run manifests (`manifest.dryrun.json`)
- [ ] Delete dry-run manifest after successful run
- [ ] Document manifest operations in `doc/modules/manifest.md`

#### 5.2 Config Manager

- [ ] Load config from JSON file
- [ ] Default config values
- [ ] Config validation
- [ ] Future: Environment variable override support (NORMPIC_*)
- [ ] Document configuration in `doc/guides/configuration.md`

### 6. Utilities (`lib/util/`)

#### 6.1 Filesystem Utilities

- [ ] Mock filesystem for testing
- [ ] Symlink creation and validation
- [ ] Detect broken symlinks
- [ ] Check for flat directory structure (warn if nested)
- [ ] File hash computation (SHA-256)
- [ ] Handle file formats: .jpg, .png, .heic, .webp
- [ ] Document filesystem operations in `doc/modules/filesystem.md`

### 7. CLI Implementation (`cli/main.py`)

- [ ] Single command: `normpic`
- [ ] Flags:
  - `--dry-run`: Generate manifest without creating symlinks
  - `--verbose`: Show each pic being processed
  - `--force`: Reprocess everything ignoring cache
  - `--config`: Path to config file (default: `./config.json`)
- [ ] Output summary: "Processed X pics, Y warnings, Z errors"
- [ ] Distinguish warnings vs errors in output
- [ ] Return appropriate exit codes
- [ ] Create CLI usage guide in `doc/guides/cli.md`

### 8. Testing Strategy

#### 8.1 Integration Tests (`test/integration/`)

- [ ] Review and adapt tests from `deleteme-normpic-modules/test/`
- [ ] End-to-end test: source directory -> symlinks + manifest
- [ ] Test with mock filesystem
- [ ] Test dry-run mode
- [ ] Test force reprocessing
- [ ] Test incremental updates
- [ ] Document testing approach in `doc/CONTRIBUTE.md`

#### 8.2 Unit Tests (`test/unit/`)

- JSON Schema allows tool independence

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Processes 24GB photo collection efficiently
- [ ] Produces valid, schema-compliant manifests
- [ ] Maintains pic order with proper burst handling
- [ ] All tests pass before commits (except checkpoint branches)
- [ ] Ruff checks pass on all code
- [ ] Clear separation between library and CLI
- [ ] Documentation of performance improvements
- [ ] Complete documentation for all modules
- [ ] Deletion of deleteme directory indicates MVP completion

## Development Rules

1. TDD: Write integration test ->
    fail -> write unit tests -> implement -> green -> refactor
2. No commits without passing tests (except checkpoint branches: "Chk: [description]")
3. All code must pass ruff checks
4. Use mocked filesystem in tests
5. Lazy processing by default (skip unchanged pics)
6. Warnings continue, errors stop
7. JSON Schema validation for all manifest operations
8. Update documentation with every commit
9. Log changes in CHANGELOG.md daily
10. Reference and adapt useful specs from deleteme directory
11. Delete obsolete deleteme content as it's replaced
