# NormPic

Organize and rename photo collections with
a consistent schema across remote and local storage.

## Overview

NormPic helps you standardize disparate photo collections whether
from multiple photographers, different cameras, or various sources
into a unified naming schema and manifest file tracking it.
Organize wedding photos, vacation sets, or any collection of images with
chronological sorting and custom tagging,
all while supporting both local filesystem and S3 as sources and destinations.

## Features

- **Multi-source support**: Read from local filesystem or S3
- **Multi-destination support**: Write to local filesystem or S3
- **Consistent naming schema**: Apply customizable naming conventions across your collection
- **Chronological sorting**: Organize by EXIF timestamps or file metadata
- **Batch processing**: Handle entire photo collections efficiently
